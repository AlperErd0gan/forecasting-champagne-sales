# 1. Introduction

  

A compact notebook focused on analysis/experiments. This README gives you the essentials to open and run it quickly.

  

## Contents

- Notebook: `solution_Alper_Erdogan.ipynb`

- Main sections:
1. Introduction 
2. Environement and Dataset 
3. Runing the code provided for ARIMA solution
4. Solution Provided
5. Possible Hybrid Model
6. Conclusion

  

## Environment

- Python 3.10.9 Kernel: base

- Dependencies: inspect, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, pickle, scikit-learn, scipy, statsmodels, warnings.


## Data
These file paths were referenced in code (check/update as needed):

-  `champagne.csv`

-  `dataset.csv`

-  `models/ets_best.pkl`

-  `models/ets_best_config.json`

-  `validation.csv`

  

## How to Run

1. Create and activate a virtual environment.

2. Install dependencies (e.g., `pip install -r dependencies.txt` and then the packages above).

  

3. Open `solution_Alper_Erdogan.ipynb` in JupyterLab/Notebook and run cells.

4. If any data paths are missing, place the files in the indicated locations or update the paths in the notebook.
